The object-oriented pattern that I chose to implement was the Mediator. The mediator is implemented in a few places, one
of them being LoanService.java. LoanService.java is an interface which encompasses how loan contents are processed and verified,
getting loans pertaining to an account, submitting a loan application, and getting the status of a loan application.
Another mediator class is the AuthService.java interface. AuthService.java defines how users are registered and authenticated,
no matter whether they are a customer or a loan manager.


The user interface pattern I chose to implement were Cards. Cards are implemented within the dashboard.html and newLoan.html
files/views, and are essentially div elements with rounded corners and box shadows to give the presence of depth
and containerization between each of the card's contents. I used CSS styling and padding, as well as flexbox in order to
achieve the responsive card UI pattern design.
